      "Interacts with the product owner to ensure product development meets product owner’s expectations. Manages the tasks of the scrum team’s members. Protects the interests of the scrum team from the product owner’s demands. A Scrum Master builds trust and clears up confusion with issues. A Scrum Master is a people’s person and is calm under pressure. A Scrum Master creates stories and tasks for the current sprint and monitors the progress of team members’ progress on those tasks. Often, tasks in the backlog have already been created by the Product owner, so the Scrum Master just needs to choose which ones to work on during the sprint, and if those need to be broken down into smaller tasks that can be done during a sprint. The Scrum Master reviews the backlog and develops sprint plan for the next sprint. Reviews tasks in current sprint at the end of the sprint and decides what should be moved to the next sprint, what should be closed out, and what should be moved to the backlog."
