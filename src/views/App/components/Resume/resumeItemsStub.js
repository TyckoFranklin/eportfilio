      "I have been programming for over 14 years. I am a self-motivated worker and student who strives for excellence. My programming skills were largely self-taught, with education and professional experience adding to my skill set. I have strong analytical skills, and love to figure out solutions to challenging problems. I learn fast, work well in teams as well as independently. I have a passion for front-end and back-end web development. I strive to write clean, maintainable, scalable, and efficient code."

      `I developed code and scripts to auto test web applications using Selenium Webdriver, Jest and PHPUnit to perform unit, integration, and end to end testing. I helped develop scripts for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment through Jenkins and Bamboo using PowerShell, Groovy Scripts, and Shell. Project deliverables I worked on include Socrates, CORE (1 and 2), and Linkages. I also had the pleasure of participating on-site field work using CORE for a project in Brownsville, TX. 
      Meta Editor for Entity: Dynamic plugin for the 3rd party Halo map editor Entity that allowed the editing of map file binary data based on structures provided by XML plugins. 
      Gift Exchange Names Generator: Would randomly generate and email out the name of each person’s gift exchange recipient, as well as create a master list that could be used by the program for next year to avoid repeat pairs.
      Detailed Halo Stats Reader: Fetched the HTML of a player’s Halo 3 Xbox Live game statistics from the Bungie website, and parsed them into an XML file.
      Rome Total War Campaign Editor: Read in campaign and game files for the game Rome Total War, allowed GUI editing of the files, then overwrote the original files with the parsed data.
      SC Tool Library: Massive JavaScript library for improving the game Starfleet Commander Extreme, implemented through a Google Chrome plugin.
      Imgur.com Favorites Folders: A Google Chrome plugin that allows users of Imgur to locally save their account favorites and sort them by category.
      I developed the Google Chrome Extension interface for Linkages that allowed for access to Linkages from any webpage.
